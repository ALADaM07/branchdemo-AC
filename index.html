            The origins of the Hashashins
            According to Saladin and The Fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem1, The Hashashins (Arabic and Persian for
            "assassins") originated in 1094 in Syria (and what is now northern Iran) under the leadership of Hassan-i
            Sabbah, a popular and well-respected Shia Muslim, in order to topple his enemies amidst the religious and
            political unrest in the Holy Lands. Searching for a place to establish a headquarters for his Order, Sabbah
            chose the fortress at Alamut, a sturdy, highly-defensible place by any midieval standard. Due to his high
            status, Sabbah had little problems gaining a serious following. As a result, it wasn't long after the
            settling at Alamut that the Hashashins (also referred to as Nizari Ismailis, considered a branch of the
            traditional Shia Muslims) began using agents of both espionage and assassination to gain a political
            foothold and eliminate key targets. These actions paved the way for expansion soon after.<span>>Read

            <p>“To say that nothing is true, is to realize that the foundations of society are fragile, and that we must
                be
                the shepherds of our own civilization. To say that everything is permitted, is to understand that we are
                the
                architects of our actions, and that we must live with their consequences, whether glorious or tragic.”
