            <p>“To say that nothing is true, is to realize that the foundations of society are fragile, and that we must
                be
                the shepherds of our own civilization. To say that everything is permitted, is to understand that we are
                the
                architects of our actions, and that we must live with their consequences, whether glorious or tragic.”
